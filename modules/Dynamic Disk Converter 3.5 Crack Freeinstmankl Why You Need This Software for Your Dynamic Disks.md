## How to Convert Dynamic Disk to Basic Disk without Losing Data Safely and Easily
 
There are two main ways to convert dynamic disks to basic disks without losing data: using a backup and restore method, or using a professional disk management software.
 
### Using a Backup and Restore Method
 
The backup and restore method involves backing up your data from the dynamic disk to another location, such as an external hard drive or cloud storage service, then deleting all the volumes on the dynamic disk, converting it to a basic disk using Windows Disk Management tool, and finally restoring your data from the backup location to the basic disk.
 
This method is free and simple, but it has some drawbacks. First, you need enough space on another location to store your backup data. Second, you need to delete all the volumes on the dynamic disk before converting it, which means you will lose access to your data temporarily. Third, you need to restore your data manually after converting the disk, which may take a long time depending on the size of your data.
 
### Using a Professional Disk Management Software
 
The professional disk management software method involves using a reliable and reputable software tool that can convert dynamic disks to basic disks without losing data or requiring a reboot. One such tool is Aomei Partition Assistant Professional Edition (not crack), which is developed by the same company that created Dynamic Disk Converter Professional Edition.
 
Aomei Partition Assistant Professional Edition is a powerful and versatile disk management software that can perform various operations on your disks and partitions, such as resize, move, merge, split, clone, wipe, format, align, check, etc. It also supports converting dynamic disks to basic disks without losing data or requiring a reboot.
 
To use Aomei Partition Assistant Professional Edition to convert dynamic disks to basic disks without losing data, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install Aomei Partition Assistant Professional Edition from its official website (not crack).

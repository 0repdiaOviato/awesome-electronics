## How to Use Thrausi Plugin
 
Using Thrausi plugin is very easy and intuitive. You can fracture any object in Cinema 4D by simply selecting it and clicking on the Thrausi button. You can also drag and drop a spline or a polygonal object onto the Thrausi window to use it as a cutter. Thrausi will automatically create a voronoi pattern of pieces that you can animate and control with MoDynamics.
 
Thrausi plugin has many settings and options that you can tweak to customize the look and behavior of your fractured objects. You can change the number and size of the pieces, the thickness and color of the edges, the randomness and variation of the cuts, the strength and direction of the gravity, the collision and bounce of the pieces, and much more. You can also add noise, turbulence, wind, attractors, and other forces to create more realistic and dynamic effects.
 
## How to Render Thrausi Plugin
 
Rendering Thrausi plugin is also very simple and fast. You can use any renderer that supports Cinema 4D, such as Standard, Physical, ProRender, or third-party renderers like Octane or Redshift. Thrausi plugin will automatically generate UV coordinates and materials for your fractured objects, so you don't have to worry about mapping or texturing them. You can also use the built-in Edge Shader to add more detail and realism to your edges.
 
Thrausi plugin also supports baking your animation into keyframes, so you can export your fractured objects as Alembic or FBX files and use them in other applications or render engines. You can also use the NitroBake plugin from Nitro4d to bake your MoDynamics simulation into keyframes or PLA animation. This way, you can have more control and flexibility over your fractured objects.

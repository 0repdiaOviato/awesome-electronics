## What is the Jolivet Bassoon Concerto?
 
The Jolivet Bassoon Concerto is a concerto for bassoon, string orchestra, harp, and piano. It was premiered on November 30, 1954 by Maurice Allard and the Orchestre Radio-Symphonique in Paris. It lasts about 13 minutes and consists of two movements, each with a slow and a fast section.
 
The concerto showcases the bassoon's wide range of expression, from lyrical and haunting to jazzy and humorous. It also demands a high level of technical skill and control from the soloist, who has to play fast passages, wide leaps, trills, glissandi, multiphonics, and extreme high notes.
 
### Movement I: Recitativo - Allegro Gioviale
 
The first movement begins with a Recitativo section, where the bassoon plays a solo monologue with sparse accompaniment from the orchestra. The bassoon starts with quiet and angular phrases in the high register, but gradually becomes more agitated and declamatory, running up and down the instrument vigorously. The orchestra punctuates the bassoon's speech with harsh chords and pauses.
 
The Recitativo leads into the Allegro Gioviale section, which features syncopated rhythms and jazz-like chromaticism. The orchestra plays a catchy theme that contrasts with the bassoon's acrobatic and ironic theme. The bassoon eventually repeats the orchestra's theme but distorts it with jarring interjections. The movement ends with a series of ascending scales and runs by the bassoon that culminate in a high F.

### Movement II: Largo Cantabile - Fugato
 
The second movement starts with a Largo Cantabile section, where the bassoon plays a lyrical and melancholic melody over a colorful accompaniment from the solo violin and the harp. The mood is somber and desolate, with the bassoon's high notes creating a wailing effect. The orchestra fades out and leaves the bassoon alone to transition into the final section.
 
The Fugato section is a dark and sinister dance of death that features some enchanting effects from the orchestra. The bassoon plays a fugue subject that is answered by the solo violin and other instruments. The fugue structure creates a dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra, which are more in harmony than in the previous movement. The movement builds up speed and intensity towards the finale, but then shifts unexpectedly to D major. The bassoon plays a final high D as the concerto ends.

## Themes and Symbols in Poetry
 
Poetry is a film that explores the meaning of life, art, and morality through the eyes of Mija, a 66-year-old woman who lives alone with her teenage grandson. Mija is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which affects her memory and cognition. She decides to enroll in a poetry class at a local cultural center, hoping to find a new way to express herself and cope with her condition.
 
However, Mija's life is further complicated by a shocking revelation: her grandson was involved in a gang rape of a schoolgirl, who later committed suicide. Mija is pressured by the fathers of the other perpetrators to contribute money for a settlement with the girl's family. She is torn between her love for her grandson and her sense of justice and empathy for the victim.
 
Poetry is a film that contrasts the beauty and ugliness of human nature, as well as the power and limitations of art. Some of the recurring symbols in the film include:
 
- The apple: Mija often eats apples, which are associated with health, knowledge, and temptation. The apple also represents Mija's desire to write a poem, as she is inspired by William Carlos Williams' poem "This Is Just To Say".
- The river: Mija lives near a river, which is where the body of the schoolgirl was found. The river symbolizes life, death, and change, as well as Mija's connection to nature and poetry.
- The camera: Mija buys a digital camera to capture images for her poems. The camera represents Mija's attempt to preserve her memories and express her creativity, as well as her curiosity and observation of the world.

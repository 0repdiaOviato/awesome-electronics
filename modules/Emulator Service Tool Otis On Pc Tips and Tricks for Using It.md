An emulator service tool is a device that allows you to communicate with and test the functions of an elevator or escalator system. It can help you diagnose problems, adjust settings, and perform maintenance tasks. One of the most popular emulator service tools is the Otis Elevator Service Tool GAA21750AK3[^2^], which can unlock escalator blue test tools unlimited times.
 
If you want to use an emulator service tool for Otis elevators on your PC, you will need to install a software package called emulator\_service\_tool\_otis\_on\_pc\_fegha[^1^]. This is a Node.js module that simulates the interface and functionality of the Otis Elevator Service Tool GAA21750AK3. You can use it to connect to any Otis elevator or escalator system that supports the GAA21750AK3 protocol.

 `node emulator_service_tool_otis_on_pc_fegha` 
This will launch the emulator service tool on your PC. You will see a graphical user interface that resembles the Otis Elevator Service Tool GAA21750AK3. You can use your mouse and keyboard to interact with it. To connect to an Otis elevator or escalator system, you will need to have a serial cable or a USB-to-serial adapter that connects your PC to the system's communication port. You will also need to configure the correct baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits for the connection.
 
Once you are connected, you can use the emulator service tool to perform various tasks on the Otis elevator or escalator system. For example, you can read and write parameters, monitor inputs and outputs, run tests, reset faults, and view logs. You can also access advanced features such as password protection, data backup and restore, firmware update, and remote control.
 
The emulator\_service\_tool\_otis\_on\_pc\_fegha module is a useful tool for anyone who works with Otis elevators or escalators. It can help you save time and money by allowing you to use your PC as an emulator service tool. However, you should always exercise caution when using it, as improper use may cause damage or injury to yourself or others. You should also follow the instructions and safety guidelines provided by Otis[^3^], the world's leading company for elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service.

In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use the emulator service tool for Otis elevators on your PC. We will assume that you have already installed and run the emulator\_service\_tool\_otis\_on\_pc\_fegha module, and that you have connected your PC to an Otis elevator or escalator system.
 
## Example 1: Reading and Writing Parameters
 
One of the most common tasks that you can perform with the emulator service tool is reading and writing parameters. Parameters are settings that control the behavior and performance of the elevator or escalator system. For example, you can change the speed, acceleration, deceleration, door opening time, floor height, and many other parameters.
 
To read and write parameters, you need to select the "Parameter" option from the main menu of the emulator service tool. You will see a list of parameter groups, such as "Basic", "Drive", "Door", "Safety", and so on. You can use the arrow keys or the mouse to scroll through the list and select a parameter group. Then, you will see a list of parameters within that group. You can use the same keys or mouse to select a parameter.
 
Once you have selected a parameter, you will see its current value and unit on the right side of the screen. You can also see its minimum and maximum values, and its default value. To change the value of a parameter, you can use the number keys or the mouse to enter a new value. Then, you need to press the "Enter" key or click on the "Write" button to send the new value to the elevator or escalator system. You will see a confirmation message on the screen if the operation is successful.
 
You can also read all the parameters in a group at once by selecting the "Read All" option from the parameter menu. This will display all the current values of the parameters in that group on the screen. You can also write all the parameters in a group at once by selecting the "Write All" option from the parameter menu. This will send all the values that you have entered on the screen to the elevator or escalator system.
 
Reading and writing parameters can help you adjust and optimize the elevator or escalator system according to your needs and preferences. However, you should be careful when changing parameters, as some of them may affect the safety and functionality of the system. You should always follow the recommendations and instructions provided by Otis when modifying parameters.
 
## Example 2: Monitoring Inputs and Outputs
 
Another common task that you can perform with the emulator service tool is monitoring inputs and outputs. Inputs and outputs are signals that communicate between the elevator or escalator system and its components, such as sensors, switches, buttons, lights, motors, brakes, and so on. By monitoring inputs and outputs, you can check the status and operation of these components.
 
To monitor inputs and outputs, you need to select the "I/O Monitor" option from the main menu of

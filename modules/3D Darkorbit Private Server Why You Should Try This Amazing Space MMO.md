- Lack of official support or updates. Private servers are not endorsed or maintained by the official Darkorbit developers, so they may have bugs, glitches, or security issues that are not fixed or addressed.
- Possibility of losing your progress or account. Private servers may shut down or reset without warning or notice, so you may lose all your achievements, items, or credits that you earned on the private server. You may also get banned or hacked by the private server's administrators or other players.
- Violation of Darkorbit's terms of service. Playing on a private server may be considered as cheating or hacking by the official Darkorbit developers, and may result in your official Darkorbit account being suspended or terminated.

Therefore, you should always play 3D Darkorbit private server at your own risk and discretion. You should also respect the rules and regulations of the private server you choose to play on, as well as the rights and privacy of other players.

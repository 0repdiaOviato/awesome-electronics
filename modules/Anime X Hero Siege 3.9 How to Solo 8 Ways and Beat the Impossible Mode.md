## Performance and Compatibility
 
Aerosoft Anchorage Professional is designed to run smoothly on Prepar3D V4/V5 with moderate to high-end systems. The product page lists the following system requirements:

- Microsoft Windows 7 / 8 / 10 (64bit)
- CPU: Quad Core with 3.5 GHz
- RAM: 16 GB DDR4 RAM (2666 MHz)
- Graphics card: 8 GB VRAM (DirectX 11)
- Disk space: 4.5 GB free disk space, SSD highly recommended

We tested the scenery on a system with an Intel Core i7-9700K CPU, 32 GB RAM, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU, and a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD. We used Prepar3D V5 with Active Sky P3D as our weather engine. We also had FTX South Alaska installed and enabled via the config tool.
 
We found that the scenery performed very well on our system, with no noticeable stutters or frame drops. The loading times were also reasonable, considering the amount of detail and textures. The scenery looked stunning in both day and night conditions, with realistic lighting and shadows. The dynamic lighting was especially impressive at night, creating a lively atmosphere around the airport.
 
The scenery was also compatible with other add-ons we had installed, such as Orbx Global Base Pack, Orbx Vector, Orbx OpenLC North America, Orbx Trees HD, GSX Level 2, Ultimate Traffic Live, etc. We did not encounter any conflicts or issues with these add-ons.

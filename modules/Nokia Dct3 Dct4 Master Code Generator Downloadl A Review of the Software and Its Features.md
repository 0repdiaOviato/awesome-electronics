If you have forgotten your security code or want to use a different SIM card on your Nokia phone, you may need to unlock it with a master code. A master code is a 10-digit number that can override the security code and reset it to the default one. There are many online tools that can generate a master code for your Nokia phone based on its IMEI number and network.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use two of the most popular and free master code generators for Nokia phones: DCT3 and DCT4. These tools work for most Nokia models that belong to the DCT3 and DCT4 platforms, such as 3310, 3410, 3510, 5110, 6110, 6210, 6310, 6510, 8210, 8310, 8810 and more.

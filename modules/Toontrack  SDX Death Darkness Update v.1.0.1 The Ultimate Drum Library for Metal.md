## What is SDX Death & Darkness?
 
SDX Death & Darkness is a sound expansion library for Superior Drummer 3, Toontrack's flagship drum software. It was released in September 2019 and features nine complete drum kits, 19 bass drums, 19 snare drums, 35 cymbals and more. The library covers a wide range of metal subgenres and styles, from death metal to metalcore, from black metal to progressive metal.
 
What makes SDX Death & Darkness unique is that it was recorded at two different studios by two different producers, each with their own signature sound and approach. The 'Death' part of the library was recorded by Mark Lewis at the Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas. Mark Lewis is a renowned metal producer who has worked with bands like Cannibal Corpse, Whitechapel, Coal Chamber and more. The Sonic Ranch is a state-of-the-art studio that offers a pristine and balanced sound with a natural reverb. The 'Darkness' part of the library was recorded by Tue Madsen at the Antfarm Studio in Aarhus, Denmark. Tue Madsen is another legendary metal producer who has worked with bands like Meshuggah, Behemoth, Hatesphere and more. The Antfarm Studio is a former swimming pool that offers a dark and raw sound with a unique ambience.
 
By combining these two studios and producers, SDX Death & Darkness gives you the best of both worlds: a clean and crisp sound that can cut through any mix, and a dirty and gritty sound that can add character and depth to any track. You can mix and match the kits and sounds from both studios to create your own custom drum tones and mixes. You can also use the custom mix presets that were engineered by Mark Lewis, Tue Madsen and Toontrack themselves.
 
## Why Should You Use SDX Death & Darkness?
 
If you are a metal producer or musician, SDX Death & Darkness is a must-have library for your arsenal. It offers you a huge variety of drums that can suit any metal project you are working on. Whether you need a fast and furious blast beat, a heavy and groovy breakdown, or a complex and technical riff, SDX Death & Darkness has you covered. You can easily tweak the sounds to your liking using the powerful features of Superior Drummer 3, such as the mixer, the effects, the envelopes, the mapping and more.
 
SDX Death & Darkness is also a great tool for learning and inspiration. You can study how the pros record and mix their drums by analyzing the presets and the raw sounds. You can also use the MIDI files that were performed by Sean Reinert (ex-Death, ex-Cynic) and Jay Postones (TesseracT) to get some ideas for your own drum parts or to practice your playing skills.
 
SDX Death & Darkness is not only for metal fans though. It can also be used for other genres that require powerful and dynamic drums, such as rock, industrial, cinematic or even pop. You can use SDX Death & Darkness to add some edge and punch to your tracks or to create some contrast and tension in your arrangements.
 
## How to Get SDX Death & Darkness?
 
If you are interested in getting SDX Death & Darkness for your Superior Drummer 3 software, you can visit Toontrack's website and purchase it online for USD 179. You will need about 184 GB of free disk space to install the library on your computer. You will also need an internet connection to download the library and activate it using the Toontrack Product Manager.
 
If you are not sure if SDX Death & Darkness is right for you, you can also download a free demo version from Toontrack's website and try it out for yourself. The demo version includes one kit from each studio (Death: Kit 1 / Darkness: Kit 5) and some MIDI files from each drummer (Sean Reinert / Jay Postones). The demo version has some limitations though: you cannot save or export your projects or presets, you cannot use third-party MIDI files or hosts, and you cannot access some features of Superior Drummer 3.
 
## Conclusion
 
Toontrack's SDX Death & Darkness is one of the most comprehensive and versatile drum libraries for modern metal production. It offers you a huge amount of drums that were recorded at two different studios by two different producers, giving you a wide range of sounds and options to choose from. It also

## Step 1: Download the No-CD Crack
 
The first thing you need to do is download a no-CD crack that will replace the original game executable with a patched one that does not require the CD to play. You can find the no-CD crack at [^1^] or [^3^]. Extract the files from the archive and copy them to the installation directory of Theme Park Inc, overwriting the existing files.
 
## Step 2: Edit the Configuration Files
 
The next step is to edit some configuration files in the Data folder of Theme Park Inc. These files control the graphical settings of the game and need to be modified to enable 32-bit rendering and textures. Open the low.sam, med.sam, and high.sam files with Notepad and change the lines 'GraphicalOptions.RENDER32' and 'GraphicalOptions.TEXTURE32' from '0' to '1'. Save and close the files.
 
## Step 3: Run the Game in Compatibility Mode
 
The final step is to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2) and as an administrator. To do this, right-click on the game.exe file and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the boxes for 'Run this program in compatibility mode for:' and 'Run this program as an administrator'. Click Apply and OK.

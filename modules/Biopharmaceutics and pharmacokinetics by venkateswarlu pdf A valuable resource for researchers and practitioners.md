Biopharmaceutics covers the different factors such as biological, physiochemical and formulation that influence the therapeutic efficacy of a drug. The book explains how these factors affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of drugs in the body. The book also discusses the concepts of bioavailability, bioequivalence, biowaiver and biosimilarity of drugs.
 
Pharmacokinetics covers the fundamentals of one compartment open model, multi-compartmental models, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, clearance concepts, pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacokinetic models. The book presents the mathematical equations using simple integration and differentiation methods and provides practice problems and question bank at the end of each chapter. The book also includes a chapter on biostatistics with practice problems.
 
The second edition of the book has some new features such as application of principles in formulation development in industry for successful bioequivalence studies, a chapter on in-vitro dissolution testing to evaluate test formulations for bioequivalence studies and updated references.
 
The book is written in a simple and lucid language and is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of pharmacy as well as professionals working in the field of drug development and regulation. The book is available in pdf format online[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

In this article, we will show you how to use Design Doll to create realistic and expressive human poses. You will learn how to adjust the body proportions, manipulate the joints, apply poses from the library, and customize the appearance of the models. You will also learn how to export your poses as images or 3D files for further editing.
 
## Step 1: Adjust the Body Proportions
 
When you launch Design Doll, you will see a default male model in a T-pose. You can change the gender of the model by clicking on the icon at the top left corner of the screen. You can also adjust the body proportions by dragging the sliders on the right panel. You can change the height, head size, chest size, waist size, hip size, leg length, arm length, and hand size of the model. You can also use the presets to quickly switch between different body types.
 
## Step 2: Manipulate the Joints
 
To pose the model, you can simply click and drag on any joint of the body. You can rotate, bend, twist, or stretch the joints in any direction. You can also use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out of the model. You can use the buttons on the left panel to switch between different views of the model, such as front, side, back, top, or bottom. You can also use the arrow keys to move the model around the screen.
 
## Step 3: Apply Poses from the Library
 
If you don't want to pose the model from scratch, you can use the pose library to apply predefined poses to your model. You can access the pose library by clicking on the icon at the top right corner of the screen. You can browse through different categories of poses, such as standing, sitting, lying down, action, expression, or hand gesture. You can also search for poses by keywords or tags. To apply a pose to your model, simply double-click on it or drag and drop it onto your model.
 
## Step 4: Customize the Appearance of the Models
 
You can also customize the appearance of your models by changing their skin color, hair style, eye color, clothing, accessories, or facial features. You can access these options by clicking on the icons at the bottom right corner of the screen. You can choose from a variety of presets or create your own custom styles. You can also adjust the lighting and shadows of your scene by clicking on the icon at the bottom left corner of the screen.
 
## Step 5: Export Your Poses as Images or 3D Files
 
Once you are happy with your pose, you can export it as an image or a 3D file for further editing. To export your pose as an image, click on the camera icon at the top center of the screen. You can choose from different formats, such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, or TIFF. You can also adjust the resolution and quality of your image. To export your pose as a 3D file, click on the file icon at the top center of the screen. You can choose from different formats, such as OBJ, FBX, STL, or VRM. You can also adjust some settings such as scale and texture.

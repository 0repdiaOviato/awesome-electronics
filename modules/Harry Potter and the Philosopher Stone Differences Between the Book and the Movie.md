On his eleventh birthday, Harry receives a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, inviting him to attend as a student. He also meets Hagrid, a half-giant who works as the school's gamekeeper and reveals to Harry that he is a wizard and that Voldemort is the most feared dark wizard of all time. Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley, a hidden street in London where wizards buy their supplies, and helps him buy his school items, including a wand that shares a core with Voldemort's.
 
At Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House, along with his new friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes enemies with Draco Malfoy, a snobbish Slytherin student, and Professor Snape, the potions teacher who seems to hate him. Harry discovers that he has a natural talent for flying on a broomstick and becomes the youngest seeker in history for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, a sport played on flying brooms.
 
Throughout the year, Harry and his friends encounter various mysteries and dangers at Hogwarts, such as a three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor, a forbidden corridor with a bloodthirsty troll, and a series of clues that lead them to suspect that someone is trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone), a powerful object that can grant eternal life and turn any metal into gold. The stone belongs to Nicolas Flamel, an alchemist and friend of Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
 
Harry eventually learns that Voldemort is behind the plot to steal the stone, and that he is using Quirrell, the defense against the dark arts teacher, as his host. Harry confronts Quirrell in the underground chamber where the stone is hidden and protected by various enchantments. He manages to prevent Quirrell from getting the stone with the help of his mother's love, which burns Quirrell when he touches Harry. Voldemort flees from Quirrell's body and Harry passes out from the pain of his scar.
 
Harry wakes up in the hospital wing and is greeted by Dumbledore, who explains what happened and praises him for his bravery. He also tells him that he destroyed the stone to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Harry joins his friends for the end-of-year feast, where Gryffindor wins the house cup thanks to the points awarded to Harry and his friends for their heroism. Harry leaves Hogwarts for the summer holidays with mixed feelings: he is happy to have found a home and friends in the wizarding world, but he also knows that Voldemort is still out there and will try to kill him again.

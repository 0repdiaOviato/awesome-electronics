# How to Play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors Without a CD
 
Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors is a classic real-time strategy game that has been enjoyed by millions of players since its release in 2000. However, if you have lost or damaged your original CD, you might be wondering how you can play this game without it. Fortunately, there are some ways to do so, and this article will show you how.
 
One way to play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors without a CD is to use a no-CD patch or crack. A no-CD patch or crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without inserting the CD. There are many sources online where you can download no-CD patches or cracks for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors, but you should be careful and only use trusted and verified ones, as some might contain viruses or malware.

One reliable source for no-CD patches or cracks for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors is GameBurnWorld[^1^], which offers several versions of no-CD patches or cracks for different languages and game updates. To use a no-CD patch or crack from GameBurnWorld, you need to download the file that matches your game version and language, and then replace the original age2\_x1.exe file in your game folder with the downloaded one. You can find your game version by checking the bottom right corner of the main menu screen. You should also make a backup copy of your original age2\_x1.exe file before replacing it, in case something goes wrong.
 
Another reliable source for no-CD patches or cracks for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors is Reddit[^2^], where you can find a link to a no-CD cracked copy of the age2\_x1.exe file for the 1.0c version (the latest version) of the game. This no-CD cracked copy can be patched with the AOE 2 UserPatch and still retain the no-CD patch. It also works for LAN multiplayer with other players that use the same copy of the crack. To use this no-CD cracked copy, you need to download the file from the link provided in the Reddit post, and then replace your original age2\_x1.exe file with the downloaded one. Again, you should make a backup copy of your original age2\_x1.exe file before replacing it.
 
A third way to play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors without a CD is to use an ISO file and a virtual drive. An ISO file is an image file that contains all the data from a CD or DVD, and a virtual drive is a software that emulates a physical CD or DVD drive on your computer. By using an ISO file and a virtual drive, you can mount the ISO file as if it were a real CD or DVD, and then run the game from it. This way, you don't need to insert the actual CD or DVD into your computer.
 
To use an ISO file and a virtual drive to play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors without a CD, you need to have an ISO file of your original game CD or DVD, and a virtual drive software such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO. If you don't have an ISO file of your original game CD or DVD, you can create one by using an ISO creation software such as ImgBurn or CDBurnerXP. You should also make sure that your ISO file is not corrupted or damaged, as this might cause errors when running the game.
 
Once you have an ISO file of your original game CD or DVD, and a virtual drive software installed on your computer, you need to mount the ISO file using the virtual drive software. This will create a virtual CD or DVD drive on your computer that contains the ISO file. You can then run the game from this virtual drive as if it were a real CD or DVD. You should also unmount the ISO file when you are done playing, as this will free up some resources on your computer.
 
These are some of the ways to play Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors without a CD. However, you should be aware that using no-CD patches or cracks might violate the terms

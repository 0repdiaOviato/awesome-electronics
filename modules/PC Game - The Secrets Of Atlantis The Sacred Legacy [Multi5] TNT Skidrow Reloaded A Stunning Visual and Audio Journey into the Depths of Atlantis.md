If you are looking for a classic adventure game with a captivating story and beautiful graphics, The Secrets Of Atlantis The Sacred Legacy may be a good choice for you. The game will take you on a journey across different cultures and civilizations, where you will encounter ancient mysteries and hidden dangers. The game also offers multiple endings depending on your choices and actions throughout the game.
 
However, if you are looking for a challenging and innovative gameplay experience, you may be disappointed by the game's simplicity and linearity. The game's puzzles are mostly based on inventory manipulation and trial-and-error, and the game's interface is sometimes clunky and unresponsive. The game's voice acting is also subpar and sometimes out of sync with the characters' lips. The game's story is also full of clichÃ©s and plot holes, and the game's ending is abrupt and unsatisfying.
 
Overall, The Secrets Of Atlantis The Sacred Legacy is a decent adventure game that may appeal to fans of the genre and the Atlantis series, but it is not a masterpiece or a must-play. The game has its charms and flaws, and it may be worth a try if you can find it at a reasonable price or download it for free. However, be aware of the potential risks of downloading from illegal sources, and always scan your files for viruses before installing them.
  
One of the highlights of the game is its graphics, which are stunning and detailed. The game's backgrounds are rich and colorful, and the game's characters are realistic and expressive. The game also features some impressive cutscenes and animations that enhance the game's atmosphere and immersion. The game's music is also well-done and fitting for the game's setting and mood. The game's soundtrack is composed by Pierre EstÃ¨ve and StÃ©phane Picq, who also worked on the previous Atlantis games.
 
Another highlight of the game is its diversity and variety. The game takes you to different locations around the world, each with its own culture, history and secrets. The game also features different gameplay modes, such as stealth, action and exploration. The game also offers some degree of interactivity and choice, as you can interact with various objects and characters, and influence the game's outcome by your decisions. The game also has some replay value, as you can try different paths and endings.
 
In conclusion, The Secrets Of Atlantis The Sacred Legacy is a mixed bag of a game that has some strengths and weaknesses. The game is not perfect, but it is not terrible either. The game may appeal to some players who enjoy adventure games with a historical and mystical theme, but it may not satisfy others who expect more from a modern game. The game is worth a try if you are curious about it, but it is not a must-have for your collection.

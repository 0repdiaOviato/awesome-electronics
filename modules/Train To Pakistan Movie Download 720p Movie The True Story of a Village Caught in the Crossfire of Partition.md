The film is set in Mano Majra, which is a quiet fictional village on the border of India and Pakistan, close to where the railway line crosses the Sutlej River. The film develops around the love affair of small-time dacoit Juggut Singh (Nirmal Pandey), with a local Muslim girl, Nooran (Smriti Mishra). [^4^] Mano Majra, incidentally, was the original title of the book upon its release in 1956. [^4^]
 
The villagers are a mix of Sikhs and Muslims, who live in harmony. The Sikhs own most of the land, and the Muslims work as labourers. During the summer of 1947, when the Partition of India was taking place, the entire country was a hotbed of extremism and intolerance. The Muslims in India moved towards the newly formed Pakistan, and the Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan migrated to refugee camps in India. One day, a train arrives from Pakistan, which carries bodies of all the Sikh and Hindu children, Women and Men who have been butchered while they tried to depart from Pakistan. That is when this quiet village is changed forever. [^4^]
 
The film depicts the turmoil faced by the inhabitants of Mano Majra as they are caught between their loyalty to their community and their humanity. The film also explores the role of Hukum Chand (Mohan Agashe), the District Magistrate who tries to maintain law and order in his jurisdiction. He is also a flawed character who indulges in alcohol and prostitution. [^5^]

She faced many challenges and obstacles in making this film, including financial constraints, censorship issues, and casting difficulties. She said, "It was a very difficult film to make. It took me seven years to get it off the ground. I had to fight for every frame."
 
Train To Pakistan is a film that deserves to be watched by everyone who wants to understand the impact of partition on the lives of millions of people. It is a film that reminds us of the importance of peace and harmony among different communities and religions. It is a film that celebrates the human spirit and its ability to overcome hatred and violence.
